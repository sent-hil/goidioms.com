Go is a simple, yet powerful language that combines the productivity of dynamic languages with performance of statically compiled languages. I like it a lot and use it every day in my day job and for my personal projects. While the Go standard library has pretty good documentation, I find myself reimplementing the same patterns and idioms for nontrivial code. This site is my attempt at capturing those repetitive code to help me save time and also to share with others.
